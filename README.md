## Research Statement
I am a computational biologist dedicated to translational biomedical research, integrating machine learning, immunology, and male reproductive biology to drive scientific innovation. My expertise includes leading diverse projects, coding, performing statistical analyses, and converting complex biological data into actionable insights alongside principal investigators and cross-disciplinary teams.

In my current role in Dr. Don F. Conrad’s lab at OHSU, I investigate the genomics of reproduction and the genetics of infertility, primarily focusing on testis biology and multi-omics data. This aligns with my broader research interests, emphasizing integrating high-dimensional multi-omics datasets, performing cross-species analysis, and employing statistical inference and computational omics to support clinical and preclinical initiatives.

I actively consult across labs, providing technical training and mentorship to graduate students guiding their research and career development. I am passionate about exploring the immune system's role in organismal health, development, and aging. By harnessing advanced computational methods, I aim to address research questions that were previously inaccessible.

My career has been defined by consistent advancement and a focus on statistical, machine learning, and data analytic methods relevant to translational and clinical research. I have played a pivotal role in designing, implementing, and analyzing extensive research projects, combining wet lab and in silico methodologies to develop hypotheses and transform data into actionable outcomes. My work upholds rigorous quality control across various omics data types to ensure integrity and reproducibility. Through statistical consultations and analyses, I have contributed significantly to clinical study documentation, scientific publications, presentations, grants, and regulatory filings in both academic and industry settings.

Currently, I am interested in leading and developing teams to create software, pipelines, and testing methodologies tailored for analyzing and translating complex biomedical data, supporting impactful translational research by integrating data types and applying robust statistical methodologies and computational tools. With the advent of large language models (LLMs), such tasks and aims can be rapidly scaled; thus my work includes fine-tuning, testing, and deploying specialized LLM for biomedical research.
