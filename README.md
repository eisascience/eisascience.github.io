## Research Statement
I am a computational biologist focused on multi-disciplinary translational biomedical research. I am fascinated by how the immune system, throughout life, functions and influences the development, health, and death of the organism. Specifically, leveraging modern technology, computational power, and statistics to bring about new insight and information, as well as testing research hypotheses that were not previously possible. Currently, I am focused on two domains of biomedical research split between the labs of Don F. Conrad Ph.D., and Benjamin Bimber Ph.D., and mainly work with single-cell transcriptomic data.  In the Conrad Lab, broadly, we investigate the genetics of male infertility and in the Bimber lab, we are focused on the immune system, often, T cells, in the context of several infectious diseases including HIV, CMV, YF, CHIKV, and others.
